        <p>
          I am a motivated software developer with a strong focus on clean structures, maintainable
          code, and practical solutions. I work analytically and in a self-organized manner,
          breaking down complex problems into manageable steps while placing great emphasis on clear
          architecture and readable code. Through personal projects, I continuously expand my
          technical knowledge and apply new concepts directly in practice.

          I work in a structured and self-organized way and feel most productive in remote
          environments. At the same time, I'm open to well-designed hybrid setups, especially during
          onboarding or for key team sessions.

        <p>
          I work in a structured, reliable, and self-driven way. I approach challenges methodically:
          clarifying requirements, breaking them into manageable steps, implementing solutions
          cleanly, and iterating when needed. I value clear communication, understandable
          structures, and code that remains maintainable over time.

        <p>
          I'm open-minded and enjoy learning new technologies. Through hands-on projects, best
          practices, and iterative improvements, I continuously develop my skills.
